# Useless Bash Scripts

### Those are some random scripts I made in bash. Here is na explanation of how to use them:
## 1. Count:
Its a fractions calculator, just type in four numbers and give it an operation (+, -, /, *). And PLEASE dont type in 0, becouse I forgot to fix that ;)
## 1.1 Count2:
The same as the previous one BUT with the zero problem fixed and a MUCH more efficient way of calculating the addition and subtraction. AND remember about the bash intiger limit.
## 2. Click_me:
A stupid little script, that just says it hacked you lol.
## 3. Game:
A simple game about eating letters. You move with WASD. To exit press q or just ctrl + c.
## More coming later (Probably)
I'll try uploading something soon.
## How to use:
Just download and use `bash <script_name>`. Linux is required or at least a VM.
### Hope you like them :)
